Zimmerman15
===========

This is a Haskell implementation of the
[Zimmerman15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/776) obfuscation scheme.

It is intended for research purposes and may be insecure. We implement
optimizations that have no proof of security yet.

It uses [CLT13](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/183) as the underlying multilinear map,
and is dependent on [our implementation](https://github.com/spaceships/clt13).
